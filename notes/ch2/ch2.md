# Chapter 2
> ## overview
> Will cover `lexical analysis`, parsing, and intermediate code generation.

> A programming language can be defined by describing what its program looks like (*the syntax of the language*) and what its program means (*the semantics of the language*). For specifying the syntax of a language, we present a widely used notation, called context-free grammars or BNF (*Backus-Naur form*) - there are also EBNF (Extended-BNF) commonly uesd in Python and other modern parsers.
